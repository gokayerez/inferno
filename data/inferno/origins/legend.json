Done.\nNeed a high society worm dead rotting\nin the back of a trunk and or left in an alley?\n\nDone.\n\nProbably a street kid who made it into the major leagues,\nor some snot nosed Richie rich punk who got sick of champagne\nand caviar, Who cares. you know the biz and the biz got tired of you.\n\nLegends are the standard in the solar system.\nBut seeing as you are caught in this prison about\nto be sent to god knows where, you are down on your luck."
